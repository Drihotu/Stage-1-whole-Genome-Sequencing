Genomic Analysis of SA_Polony_100 Dataset: AMR Profiling and Public Health Implications
Abstract
This report presents a comprehensive genomic analysis of 100 bacterial isolates from South African polony (processed meat) samples, focusing on organism identification, antimicrobial resistance (AMR) gene detection, and virulence factor analysis. Using bioinformatics tools including BLAST, ABRicate, and custom scripts, we identified the organisms, characterized their AMR profiles, and assessed public health implications.

INTRODUCTION

Polony, a popular processed meat product in South Africa, can harbor pathogenic bacteria including Listeria monocytogenes, which poses significant public health risks. The emergence of antimicrobial resistance in foodborne pathogens necessitates comprehensive genomic surveillance to inform treatment strategies and food safety policies.
Objectives:
Identify bacterial organisms in the SA_Polony_100 dataset
Characterize antimicrobial resistance gene profiles
Identify virulence factors and toxin genes
Propose evidence-based antibiotic treatment recommendations
Assess public health implications

METHODS
1. data preparation
2. data quality control and processing
3. Denovo Genome Assembly and Evaluation
4. Organism identification via Blast
5. AMR and Virulence Gene Profiling
6. REsults
   3. RESULTS
      
3.1 ORGANISM IDENTIFICATION
BLAST analysis of the assembled contigs revealed the following organism distribution:
  The organism identified was Listeria Monocytogenes. The predominance of L. monocytogenes is concerning given its pathogenic potential and association with foodborne illness outbreaks.
